# CLI Tool

A simple CLI library. The goal here was to build an intuitive, easy to use command line interface for Java terminal applications. I made it mostly for private use, and as an exercise in use of Reflection, but maybe it'll be of use to others too. I'd love to get a message if you do use it!

The code is a little unpolished still, but I'll try to tidy it up and improve the documentation a bit.
